# Lost-and-found-tracker
As a beginner, it's just a project for my hackathon, it will be based on a platform where people can find or get their lost item, without consuming their time seperately on this, my motive of this development is to fo this without using their hand of time , hope u getting my point. Well let's see 

<br> 
base idea : it will be an automated app, (site for now or web app), where this will describe an image if that person have image of the lost item , it will auto describe as well as u can also describe in ur language but seperately, and then will match to description or image of the all posted found items, this is although a common approach but kindda innovative in a minimal way as it is automated, u will just get notification whenever it find a match to your item. so what my idea is , feel free to suggest as it's really need I guess. thank you>>
