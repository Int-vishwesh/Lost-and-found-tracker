As a beginner, it's just a project for my hackathon, it will be based on a platform where people can find or get their lost item, without consuming their time seperately on this, my motive of this development is to fo this without using their hand of time , hope u getting my point. Well let's see 

<br> 
base idea : it will be an automated app, (site for now or web app), where this will describe an image if that person have image of the lost item , it will auto describe as well as u can also describe in ur language but seperately, and then will match to description or image of the all posted found items, this is although a common approach but kindda innovative in a minimal way as it is automated, it will provoke a notification whenever it find a match to your item, there is no need to scroll the feed and wastig time. so how's my idea , feel free to suggest as it's really need I guess. thank you>>

<b> at the end detail </b>
<br>
• Two categories - lost / found
• just like an social media platforms for posting lost and found items.
• Will search or match according to given description of lost item and the uploaded found item description or even the image
• send notification if this app found a match or can manually search the feed of lost or found categories to alert them for ur items or to gave off the items.
• will send notification to each person available on this platform.
• can share link of their post.
•  auto delete after asking user, or will appear in their history archive, just like insta story.
•  will tick over the found or matched item and will be labelled as founded.
<br>
Benefits : 
• will solve a problem in a college by using matching recursively and quickly.
• create a community, so user will have idea of that item if they see somewhere in another's hand. Thus creating an awarness too, kinda, like thief.. etc in rare cases.
• will provide a stats too, about which item is recklessly getting lost mostly & all.
• in future, a premium model can be applied too, which will notify every user about ur lost item and will keep at the top of the list but with a proper urgency.
• in future, u can select a radius According to ur prediction about the in howuch area my item would have lost.
